# Portfolio_Website_Project
This is my personal portfolio website designed and developed to showcase my skills, projects, education, and professional background in a clean and responsive manner.
The website is built using HTML5 and CSS3, focusing on modern UI design, responsiveness, and user experience. It includes multiple sections such as Home, About Me, Skills, Projects, Resume, and Contact, allowing visitors to easily explore my technical expertise and project work.
The Projects section highlights my software and hardware-based work, including a GSM-Based Paralysis Patient Health Monitoring System, Speech-to-Text Converter using AWS, and this Portfolio Website itself. The site also provides a downloadable CV and a contact form for easy communication.
